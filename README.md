# DEV277x-Mod2-FractionCalculator
Module 2 Project for OOP in Java (DEV277x) - Fraction Calculator - Regular and Advanced versions.

This was the result of my project at the end of Module 2 in the DEV277x class from Microsoft. The "extra credit" portion is the "Advanced" calculator. The primary difference is that all arguments can be entered on the same line, this then gets parsed, verified, and then processed like the regular calculator. 

I know there is some unneeded code, but that is just because I cut and paste all contents of the original code into the Advanced one and didn't take out unncessary methods.
